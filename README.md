## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Create an atlas account and cluster

Go to mongodb and sign up for a free tier cluster. Add a MONGO_URI to a .env file

## Development Setup Instructions

- Run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
  ```
  While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
- Run `npm run server`
- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`
